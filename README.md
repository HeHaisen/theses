中文版和英语版都是同一个idea。不同之处在于，英语版是经过审稿人的建议进行多次修改，而中文版由于提交时间早于英文版导致两个版本的内容有所差异。并且中文版为了更符合毕业论文的要求，对内容做了些调整。英文版在中文版提交之后，添加了消融实验和额外的对比实验。  
  
The Chinese and English versions share the same idea. However, the English version has undergone several revisions based on reviewers' suggestions, while the Chinese version differs because it was submitted earlier. Moreover, adjustments were made to the Chinese version to better meet the requirements of the thesis. After the Chinese version was submitted, the English version incorporated ablation studies and additional comparison experiments.
